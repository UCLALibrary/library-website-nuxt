Named to the National Film Registry in 2004 by the Library of Congress, \u003Cem>Daughters of the Dust\u003C/em> is now essential viewing for anyone interested in the art of cinema and the power of representation. But for years, \u003Cem>Daughters\u003C/em> was itself marginalized by critics and audiences—except for those who saw themselves and their stories in its images. For contemporary Black feminist visual makers\u003Cem> Daughters of the Dust\u003C/em> has been an important cultural reference for constructing an imaginative universe that envisions decolonial possibilities for Black aesthetics. This special screening will be introduced by UCLA graduate student Zama Dube, who will offer an intimate meditation on Dash’s filmic works through the lens of a transnational Black feminism and an exploration of how its Black expressive forms continue to inspire contemporary Black filmmakers.\u003C/p>\n\n\u003Cp>35mm, color, 112 min.
