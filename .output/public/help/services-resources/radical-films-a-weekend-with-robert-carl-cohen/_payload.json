Films: A Weekend with Robert Carl Cohen","\u003Cp>Best known for \u003Cem>Mondo Hollywood\u003C/em>, a documentary time capsule of the Los Angeles counterculture of the mid-1960s, Robert Carl Cohen has spent a lifetime in pursuit of stories not otherwise told. After graduating with an M.A. in film from UCLA in 1954 followed by service in the U.S. Army, Cohen forged a pioneering career as a filmmaker, foreign correspondent, photographer, public lecturer and author focused on politics and social justice issues. Traveling the globe on assignment for national television networks, camera in hand, he gained unprecedented access to leaders and citizens alike in China, Cuba and East Germany, producing a body of non-fiction work that constitutes a one-person counterhistory to the conservative narrative that dominated American media and politics during the Cold War.
