But until the mid-20th century, the “treats” children received were not necessarily candy. Things like fruit, nuts, coins, and toys were just as likely to be given out. Trick-or-treating rose in popularity in the 1950s and it inspired candy companies to market small, individually wrapped candies. People began to favor the confections out of convenience, but candy did not dominate at the exclusion of all other treats until the 1970s when parents started fearing anything unwrapped.\u003C/p>","Halloween: Origins, Meaning & Traditions",{"id":597,"typeHandle":598,"sectionTitle":599,"sectionSummary":600,"cards":601},"51528","simpleCards","Ghosts","\u003Cp>In ghostlore, descriptions of ghosts vary widely from an \u003Ca href=\"https://www.intellectbooks.com/invisible-presence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invisible presence\u003C/a> to translucent or barely visible wispy shapes, to realistic, lifelike forms.\u003C/p>",[602,608,614],{"id":603,"typeHandle":604,"contentLink":605},"51529","internalServiceOrResource",[606],{"id":495,"uri":496,"slug":607,"title":497,"summary":498,"externalResourceUrl":54},"casper-the-ghost",{"id":609,"typeHandle":610,"title":611,"summary":612,"externalLink":613},"51530","externalServiceOrResource","Ghosts in Hamlet","Prince Hamlet may be the central character in the play named after him, but without his father's ghost, there would be no story.","https://www.livescience.com/11364-top-10-famous-ghosts.html",{"id":615,"typeHandle":610,"title":616,"summary":617,"externalLink":618},"51531","The Flying Dutchman","According to sea lore, the ship, which often appears as a hazy image or a strange light, is said to be a portent of bad luck and doom.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost",{"id":620,"typeHandle":621,"sectionTitle":622,"richTextSimplified":623,"mediaGallery":624},"50045","mediaGallery","Section Title - Media Gallery - Vintage Clown Costumes","\u003Cp>Smoking is a practice in which a substance is burned and the resulting smoke is typically breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the\u003Cstrong> \u003Ca href=\"https://genius.com/Ed-sheeran-bloodstream-lyrics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bloodstream\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue.

Most commonly, the substance used is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant, which have been rolled into a small rectangle of rolling paper to create a small, round cylinder called a cigarette. Smoking is primarily practised as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the dried plant leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue.
