Traveling the globe on assignment for national television networks, camera in hand, he gained unprecedented access to leaders and citizens alike in China, Cuba and East Germany, producing a body of non-fiction work that constitutes a one-person counterhistory to the conservative narrative that dominated American media and politics during the Cold War.
