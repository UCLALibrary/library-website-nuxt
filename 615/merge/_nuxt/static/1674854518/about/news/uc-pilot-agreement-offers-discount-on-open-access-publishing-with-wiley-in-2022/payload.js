The limited scope of this one-year pilot will allow Wiley to develop and test the multi-payer system before exploring the potential for a broader agreement in the future that would include all 10 campuses. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe agreement also provides UC students, faculty, researchers and healthcare professionals with unlimited reading access to the full portfolio of Wiley journals. \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor more details about the agreement please see the \u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Fosc.universityofcalifornia.edu\u002Fuc-publisher-relationships\u002Fwiley-pilot-open-access-agreement\u002F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003Eoverview of the Wiley open access agreement\u003C\u002Fa\u003E on the UC Office of Scholarly Communication website.
