### Week 1

1.  Why does Figma show the body font weight as `600` when it clearly isn't?
2.  Are the CSS color values P found correct? Lots of variations that are similar.
3.  Is the molecule missing from Research page
4.  For dividing lines, where is yellow and blue used?

### Week 2

1. Can we be given export SVG permissions in Figma. Or better yet, give us all SVGs in a ZIP?
1. Can we get the homepage header background molecule as one big full SVG. We don't have the skill to assemble them into one SVG. Is it the same one for the shorter headers too?
1. When the main menu is open, is it an overlay of the whole screen? Or 522px height? Or does it push down the page?
1. What is the hover color for the FooterSock links?

### Week 3

1. Figma has letter spacing listed as percentage (eg: 1%). This isn't a valid CSS var, how do you want us to translate this to something CSS can work with?
