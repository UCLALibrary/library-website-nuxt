Here are a few examples of past projects where we worked creatively with our patrons to fulfill their needs.</p>\n<p>Students from the UCLA School of Theater, Film, and Television put on a production of Paula Vogel's \"<a href=\"https://dailybruin.com/2018/11/13/actors-perform-alongside-japanese-inspired-puppets-in-drama-about-family-memory/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Long Christmas Ride Home</a>\" in 2018, featuring both live actors and custom-built puppets inspired by the Japanese puppetry form \"bunraku.\" To create the heads of the puppets, the Lux Lab worked with the TFT prop master to obtain 3D scans of each principal actor's face. The scans were turned into 3D files and printed, then painted by the TFT props crew to further recreate the physical features of the actors. The puppets helped the audience fully understand the show’s emphasis on memory and familial relations. </p>\n<p>We also work with several student organizations across campus. The <a href=\"http://rocketproject.seas.ucla.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">UCLA Rocket Project</a> is a collegiate-level engineering team housed within the <a href=\"http://aiaa.seas.ucla.edu/about.html\">UCLA American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a>. The Lux Lab has assisted the students of the Rocket Project with their competitive and educational projects. We routinely 3D-print custom rocket parts designed by the members of the project. The team has won numerous national competitions for rocket design and performance.</p>\n<p>Our projects haven't been limited to the boundaries of campus. In 2018, the Lux Lab was asked to travel to Turin, Italy, with <a href=\"https://nelc.ucla.edu/person/michael-chen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Michael Chen</a>, a doctoral candidate in archaeology. Chen was researching his thesis on Late Period Egyptian healing stones and wanted to create 3D scans of a collection of artifacts housed in the <a href=\"https://www.museoegizio.it/\">Museo Egizio</a> in Italy. His research centers around the way people interacted and used ancient objects, and he used 3D-rendered images to put the artifacts through tests and learn more about ancient Egyptian healing rituals. <br /></p>","sectionTitle":null}]}
