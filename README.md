# UCLA Library Website

A [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) powered frontend website for the UCLA Library.

## Build Setup

**This is just a Nuxt site, so it builds and deploys like any other Nuxt project.**

Works best with the [fuxt-backend](https://github.com/funkhaus/fuxt-backend) WordPress theme as the backend.

**First step:** Duplicate and rename `.example.env` to `.env`. Define any vars environment needed there.

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# serve with hot reload Storybook at localhost:3003
$ npm run storybook

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# build Stroybook for production
$ npx nuxt storybook build

# generate static project
$ npm run generate

```

## Linting

This project has linting setup for Vue/GQL/JS/SCSS/CSS and HTML using Prettier and ESLint. The ruleset is the Vue style guide "Recommended" spec.

Behind the scenes, the workflow is this: Ugly code > Prettier > ESLint > Nice code!

The idea is that Prettier formats things like CSS and GQL nicely, and ESLint goes last and does everything else. This allows us to config ESLint to the Vue specs (Prettier has little config options by design). So that is what the .eslintrc.js file is for.

In your code editor, you'll want to install a Prettier plugin ([VS Code](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-vscode) or [Atom](https://github.com/prettier/prettier-atom)), and set the "ESLint Integration" to `true` and "Format on Save" to `true`. The settings for "prettier-eslint‚Äù should have a toggle for "Run Prettier Last", you want that set to `false`. We need ESLint to run last, this ensures the Vue Recommended specs get priority, not Prettier's specs.

The 4 `devDependencies` installed in the package are "eslint", "eslint-plugin-vue", "prettier" and "prettier-eslint". The "prettier" plugin is not required as most editor plugins will use a default version they ship with, although we have more control over the version of Prettier if we include it in the package file, so we include it to be safe. It also means it would run the same server side or client side if you do that as part of CI. "prettier-eslint" is used to integrate "prettier" and "eslint" together, and get them running one after the other.

## Questions for Viget

1.  Why does Figma show the body font weight as `600` when it clearly isn't?
